Description: # Uncertainty in Hybrid LCA from price variance
        
        This library can be used to map BACI trade flows to the reference products of
        ecoinvent activities. It is built around a the hybridisatoin package for ecoinvent
        3.5 and EXIOBASE pylcaio[https://github.com/MaximeAgez/pylcaio] by Maxime Agez[https://github.com/MaximeAgez].
        
        Price data is a crucial component linking physical LCA data with monetary MRIO data. 
        Commodity price are subject to various market dynamics and trade relations, leading to high
        variance in the pirce of the given commodity. This package links BACI trade flows
        ecoinvent activities based on their reference product and geographical resolution/information
        to obtain a volume weighted price distribution for the refrence products. 
        
        Two notebooks are provided to guide the users in how to use the various functions.
